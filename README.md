### Hi! My name is Kim 😊

Before graduating in March 2020 from Hackbright Academy, I worked as an EMT in hopes of becoming a Physician Assistant but found my passion for coding from self learning Python in my spare time. I am currently searching for my first position as a Software Engineer and feeling enthusiastic about it!
