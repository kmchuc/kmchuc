### Hello! 👋 My name is Kim 

Before graduating in March 2020 from Hackbright Academy, I worked as an EMT in hopes of becoming a Physician Assistant but found my passion for coding from self learning Python in my spare time. I am currently searching for my first position as a Software Engineer and feeling enthusiastic about it! 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
<ul>
  <li><b>My Portfolio</b>: one of my goals for 2021 was to explore my creative side a lot more, and I'm hoping to achieve that through my portfolio</li>
  <li><b>Coding Interview Questions</b>: another 2021 goal of mine was to get more serious about practising leetcode/hackerrank coding problems</li>
</ul>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
<ul>
  <li><b>how to tackle interview questions again</b>: starting with arrays</li>
